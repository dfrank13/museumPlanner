# museumPlanner
Final project for LIS657 - a tool to plan museum outings in NYC
link to site: http://mysite.pratt.edu/~dfrank13/index.html

Initial Prototype Update:

Shallow aspects: 
*The list of museums are hardcoded to show a sample of what the features on the site should be doing.
*The map is a link to a map I created using Carto which shows the density of museums and also shows the name, address, and webside of each museum on the list, but I would like to switch to a Google map API as this will allow me to have more control over what museums are showing sync the map with the search features

Things that work/don't work:
*The Museum Name search bar does not work, and I'm considering getting rid of it, because I'm not sure how necessary the tool is, but I'll wait for user feedback to get more of an opinion.
*The days checkboxes currently do not work nor does the discount checkbox, but the borough checkboxes are working and can be activated using the search button to filter the list
*At the bottom of the page are the customized lists. The Add to: buttons are working, but are currently only coordinated to work with the first museum on the list. I was thinking it might be nice to add a reset button and/or. a remove button to each of the lists as well.
